I started Learn.co at the very end of December and one of my New Year resolutions for 2016 was to program every day. I was determined to get through the Learn.co curriculum within 5 months, start preparing for developer interviews at the beginning of the summer, and hopefully find myself working as a developer full-time by the end of the summer.

And then life happened.

I had to move from SF to NYC for personal reasons in the middle of April and, even though I'd done a good job of coding daily up until that point, I found that I didn't have enough time to say goodbye to friends in SF, pack up my life, move to NYC, and find an apartment while working full-time and trying to finish the Learn.co curriculum. As a result, I decided to pause my program for 1.5 months while I moved.

In retrospect, I think that was probably the right call. There was a short period of time when I was trying to do everything (working, moving, and coding) and I found that I didn't have the mental energy required to learn how to code. Even though I was still blocking off time to learn a bit of programming every day at the beginning of my move, I found that I was quickly forgetting things I'd learned because my mind was so full of other things going on.

That said, when I decided to pick the program back up again at the beginning of May, I found that having taken the 1.5 months off made it so I had to go back and relearn some of the more basic concepts I'd already mastered (what does MVC stand for again?). Thankfully it was much easier to pick those concepts up again the second time, but I wish that I hadn't had to go back and relearn them all again.

Moving forward, as much as possible, I'm going to try to code every single day so I'm building on the knowledge I already have and am continually working toward building new skills.
