In what I think is a huge testament to how amazing this program is, I've actually decided that I'm going to give becoming a developer a shot! When I started Flatiron remote, I was doing it because I wanted to understand how the web works and how languages come together to yield a website. But, over the course of my move to NYC and working on this curriculum, I decided that I want to give becoming a developer a shot. Marketing, my current field, is okay, but there's something really satisfying about building something and sharing it with the world, which is why I'm going to give this a go.

In terms of preparation, I've done the following things to get ready for the interview process:

1. Reviewed all of my Learn.co lectures. Seems obvious, but I went through and made ~300 color-coded flash cards that I'm using to drill myself on key topics
2. Took the [Udacity course on interview preparation](https://www.udacity.com/course/technical-interview--ud513). The course doesn't give you that many opportunities to practically apply your knowledge, but it does provide you with the framework through which to think about algorithms and interview problems. The last lesson also familiarizes you with what will actually happen when you're at your interview
3. [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/implementation): Amazing. It has *tons* of practice problems that helkp you review everything from Ruby, to Javascript, to algorithms. I'm going through each relevant course area to drill on core skills
4. [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/): I haven't actually pulled the trigger on this one yet, as it's $199 and I'm going to go through as many free resources as I can. That said, they have great reviews and 98% of people that have used it have been satisfied. I think it might be worth the investment

I'm excited to go out there and give this a shot!
