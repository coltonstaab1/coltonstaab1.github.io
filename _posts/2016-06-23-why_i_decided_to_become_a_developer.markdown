When I first started my job at Sunrun (my current company), I needed to learn Python to automate a number of manual processes that took me and my team a lot of time. I realized that I really loved learning programming languages and learned as much as I possibly could about using Python, SQL, etc., for data science.

The next frontier was learning how to use my programming skills for web development. I'd played around with a few Ruby courses on Treehouse, Codecademy, etc., but didn't find that they were good enough to get me to the level of proficiency I desired. When I learned about Learn.co's remote program I was really excited. The Learn.co premium program has the rigor of an in person bootcamp but is flexible enough to let me work at my own pace and on my own schedule. As a result, I decided to sign up.

I'm really glad I decided to sign up for Learn.co. I can tell that I'm becoming a better developer every day and having a better understanding of web development is changing how I think about technology.
