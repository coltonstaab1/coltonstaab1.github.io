I'm very thankful that I was an early adopter of Learn.co. I've learned a *ton* about coding as a result of going through the program and it's been a great way of learning the bootcamp curriculum without needing to take time off work. It's also allowed me to take more time to learn the material than if I were trying to cram everything into 12-16 weeks. And, because I signed up early, I was able to be part of the (since discontinued) $500/month Learn basic progam *and* was able to get a $150 holiday season discount. That brought the total monthly cost of Learn.co down to $350 for me.

Even though I'd intended to get through the program in ~12 weeks (I'd already been exposed to coding through work, so picking up basic Ruby, HTML, CSS, etc. was pretty easy), things never work out quite as you think they're going to. For personal reasons, I ended up having to move from San Francisco to NYC and had to put Learn.co on pause for ~6 weeks while I was getting ready to move. 

Originally, I was worried about being able to keep up my coding skills while I was away from Learn.co, but I managed to sneak in some review using other free sites (e.g. Treehouse, Codecademy, etc.) in between packing boxes. While I don't think those resources are nearly as good as Learn.co, they were good enough to help keep the content fresh in my mind and give me opportunities to practice material I'd already learned. 

As a result, when I returned, I found that many of the concepts I'd learned that I'd been able to practice while I were had been cemented through repeated practice. I don't think I'd be able to recall some of the more basic coding concepts I'd learned as easily if I hadn't taken time off and practiced them while not trying to plow ahead through the curriculum.

As a result, I think it might make sense for Learn.co's pricing structure to be more oriented around student results, rather than a fee per month. I think it would allow students to take the time that they need with content they find challenging without needing to feel rushed to finish the course for financial reasons. It might make sense to charge students $5,000 for the entire course and then provide them with financing to lower the monthly cost to a more reasonable rate.
