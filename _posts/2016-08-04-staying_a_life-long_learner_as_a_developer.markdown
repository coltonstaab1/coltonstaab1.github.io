I think the most valuable thing that I got out of Learn.co was that the program forced me to learn how to learn again. I've been out of college for a little over four years now, and I think it's easy to become complacent with regards to building out your skill set. After a long day at work, it can often be challenging to motivate yourself to go home and keep working on learning new skills; going to the gym, unwinding with some TV, or reading a book are tempting options! That said, it's critical to keep adapting and learning new skills to keep yourself relevant and to build your career.  Working through the demanding Learn.co curriculum at a reasonable pace while working forced me to think seriously about my time management and learning as efficiently as I possibly could. Here are some of the techniques I used to work efficiently:

1. Time-blocking: I've realized that if I don't put time on my calendar to do something that it simply doesn't happen. In the same way that I schedule meetings and time with friends, I've needed to schedule time to learn. Every time I get a Google Calendar notice that it's time to learn, I do my best to drop whatever I'm doing and use that time to make progress toward finishing the Learn.co curriculum
2. Use learning as a break at work...: I've been doing Learn.co while working, and I've found that scheduling 1-2 hours of learning time in the middle of the day works well for me. Taking time to learn is a refreshing break between meetings, answering emails, and having conference calls. Taking 1-2 hours out of my work day to learn sometimes requires staying at the office longer, but I find that I both work and learn more efficiently when I alternate between the two
3. ... but schedule long blocks on weekends to get big projects done: I learned that I was able to get the most done on long projects when I worked for extended chunks of time. Short 1-2 hour sessions were fine for learning new concepts and working through READMEs, but getting larger projects done requires long periods of concentration. I liked going to coffee shops on Saturdays or Sundays and working for 6-8 hours to get big projects done
4. Flash cards: when you're first learning something totally foreign, it's easy to gloss over terms that aren't familiar when you're reading documentation, a README lesson, etc.. But, given this course (and knowlege more generally) builds on itself, it's important to learn the terms of whatever you're trying to teach yourself. Writing a flash card for every term that's unfamiliar befor moving on with a lesson forces you to cement your understanding of the concept; it also makes it easy to review concepts while you're on the bus or train!

Hopefully some of these tactics will work for you as well!
